# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

## Overview

This project is aimed at performing sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the reviews as either positive, negative, or neutral.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of Amazon reviews collected from various product categories. It includes attributes like review text, rating, product category, etc. The dataset can be obtained from [source link].


## Results

- The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
- The confusion matrix and classification report are provided in the notebook for detailed performance analysis.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Explore advanced text preprocessing techniques.
- Incorporate deep learning models like LSTM or Transformers for improved sentiment analysis.
